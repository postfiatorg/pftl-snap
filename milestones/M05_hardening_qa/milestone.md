# Milestone 5: Hardening and QA

## Overview
Validate the host-lite experience with testing, performance checks, and security review.

## Plan
- Run manual test matrix (install, connect, switch network, send, receive).
- Execute edge-case testing (invalid address, insufficient funds, user rejection).
- Check performance and bundle size.
- Review client-side handling for security issues.
- Perform accessibility sanity checks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Test matrix completed with documented results.
- No blocking issues remain.
